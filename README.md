ESP32-BASED IOT ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING SYSTEM USING MQTT AND NODE-RED


# ESP32 IoT Environmental Monitoring & Safety Control System

This repository contains the source code, Node-RED flow, and documentation for an IoT-based environmental monitoring node developed as part of the **Internet of Things (B31TF)** coursework at **Heriot-Watt University**.

## System Overview

The ESP32 node continuously measures **Temperature**, **Humidity**, and **Dew Point** using a DHT11/22 sensor and publishes live telemetry over **MQTT** to the `test.mosquitto.org` broker. A **Node-RED dashboard** visualizes the data, performs trend analytics, and allows remote control of the node through MQTT commands.

Key features:
- DHT sensor data acquisition
- MQTT telemetry and command channel
- Node-RED dashboard visualization
- Manual Alarm Override with LED flashing alert
- Auto recovery and event logging
- Dew point calculation and anomaly detection

## Hardware Used
- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT11 or DHT22 Sensor
- NeoPixel LED (WS2812)
- USB power supply

## Communication Flow
1. ESP32 → MQTT Telemetry → Node-RED (Sensor Data)
2. Node-RED → MQTT Command → ESP32 (LED Control / Override)
3. ESP32 → MQTT Events → Node-RED (Logs & Acknowledgements)
